What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was struggling slightly with what exactly git pull was doing.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I was able to clarify with my partner that git pull will down master and unmerged branches. Thats why branches arent removed locally after a git pull.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
We asked each other lots of questions about git, especially when we were doing the merges locally. We did not have a guide.
What still confuses you about Git?
I think we both have a pretty good understanding of Git, but I'm sure more questions will arise once we learn more.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was actually an awesome experience. I was nervous to start, but Ben was an awesome partner, a nice guy, and I look forward to working with him in the future.
