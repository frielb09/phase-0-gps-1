# __Reflection__
* Prior to this GPS: I was struggling with merge conflicts. 
* Phil and I went over merge conflicts and fetching - he pointed out small errors and answered some of my questions which helped make the assignment and any future work of mine more correct. 
* Well, since the guide wasn't here, Phil really helped me out and working together we mananged to figure out issues/errors ourselves to complete the assingment. I had questions about some of the merging conflicts and fetching that came up in the assignment. 
* No, after this GPS challenge I feel more comfortable with the git version control material and Github. 
* This experience went better than I imagined; I thought I was going to have issues driving and coding but we were able to finish the challenge together without the help of the guide which gave me confidence in knowing the material.
